# Difference-between-UNIX-Linux

*LINUX
1.Definition:It is an open-source operating system which is freely available to everyone.
2.Examples:It has different distros like Ubuntu, Redhat, Fedora, etc.
3.Users:Nowadays, Linux is in great demand. Anyone can use Linux whether a home user, developer or a student.
4.Usage:Linux is used everywhere from servers, PC, smartphones, tablets to mainframes and supercomputers.
5.Cost:Linux is freely distributed,downloaded, and distributed through magazines also. And priced distros of Linux are also cheaper than Windows.
6.Development:As it is open source, it is developed by sharing and collaboration of codes by world-wide developers.
7.GUI:Linux is command based but some distros provide GUI based Linux. Gnome and KDE are mostly used GUI.
8.Interface:The default interface is BASH (Bourne Again SHell). But some distros have developed their own interfaces.
9.File system support:Linux supports more file system than Unix.
10.Coding:Linux is a Unix clone,behaves like Unix but doesn't contain its code.
11.Operating system:Linux is just the kernel.
12.Security:It provides higher security. Linux has about 60-100 viruses listed till date.
13.Error detection and solution:As Linux is open-source,whenever a user post any kind of threat, developers from all over the world start working on it. And hence, it provides faster solution.


*UNIX
1.Definition:It is an operating system which can be only used by its copyrighters.
2.Examples:IBM AIX, HP-UX and Sun Solaris.
3.Users:It was developed mainly for servers, workstations and mainframes.
4.Usage:It is used in servers, workstations and PCs.
5.Cost:Unix copyright vendors decide different costs for their respective Unix Operating systems.
6.Development:Unix was developed by AT&T Labs, various commercial vendors and non-profit organizations.
7.GUI:Initially it was command based OS, but later Common Desktop Environment was created. Most Unix distributions use Gnome.
8.Interface:It originally used Bourne shell. But is also compatible with other GUIs.
9.File system support:It also supports file system but lesser than Linux.
10.Coding:Unix contain a completely different coding developed by AT&T Labs.
11.Operating system:Unix is a complete package of Operating system.
12.Security:Unix is also highly secured. It has about 85-120 viruses listed till date
13.Error detection and solution:In Unix, users have to wait for some time for the problem to be resolved.



Let's focus some head to head comparison between Linux and Windows.

Parameter	Linux	Windows
Access	Users can access the source code of kernel in Linux and can alter the kernel according to need.	Usually, users cannot access the source code. However, members of some groups can have access to it.
Variety	Linux has several distributions that are highly customizable.	Windows have fewer options to customize.
Command-line	The command line usually referred to as Terminal, which is the most useful tool of the Linux system. It used for administration and daily tasks. For the end-users, it does not look so effective.	Windows also have a command line, but it is not such effective as a comparison to the Linux terminal. Most users prefer the GUI options for daily tasks.
Installation	The Linux installation process is a bit complicated to set up as it requires many user inputs. It takes less time than Windows to install.	Windows OS is easy to install and set up on a machine; it requires fewer user input options during installation. However, it takes more time to install as compared to Linux.
Ease of use	The Linux OS is meant to be for the technical user because you must have some exposure to various Linux commands. Users may take more time to be a handy user of Linux. The troubleshooting process is also complicated as compared to Windows.	Windows comes with simple and rich GUI options, so it is easy to use it. It can be simply used by technical as well as non-technical users. The troubleshooting process is also much easy than Linux.
Written in	Linux is written in assembly language and C.	Windows is written in C++ and assembly language.
Reliability	Linux is highly reliable and secure. It has well-established system security, process management, and uptime.	Windows is not as much reliable as Linux. However, now Windows has improved reliability but still has some security weaknesses and system instabilities.
Support	Linux has a
good support as it has a huge community of user forums and online search.

Windows also provide good support to its user. It provides free as well as paid support. It has an easily accessible online forum.
Update	Linux provides full control to its users on updates. A user can install the update whenever needed. Also, it takes less time to install an update.	Windows updates are annoying. The updates will come at any time and take too much time to install. Sometimes, you power on your machine, and updates are automatically getting started. Unfortunately, the user does not have much control over updates.
Security	Linux OS is more secure than Windows. It is hard for the hackers and attackers to find a loophole in it. So, Linux is hard to breakthrough.	Windows is less secure than Linux. Attackers primarily target the Windows for malware and virus. Windows is most vulnerable without anti-virus.
License	Linux is distributed under the GPL(GNU General Public License) license.	Windows is distributed under a Proprietary commercial software license.
